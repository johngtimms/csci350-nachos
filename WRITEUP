I. Requirements:

	Part 1:

	Part 2:

		Part 2 requires writing code (which we elected to place in threadtest.cc) to simulate a
		passport office, which will demonstrate understanding of thread synchronization principles
		including locks and condition variables.

		The passport office is to consist of threads acting out the roles of customer, application
		clerk, picture clerk, passport clerk, cashier, manager, and senator. Multiple instances of
		each role can exist, except for the manager.

		Customers progress from station to station until they have completed all tasks. Customers 
		have money which they may use to jump ahead in the lines at each station, and they will
		always choose the shortest line possible. After visiting a station, the station will 
		"process" their file after a "processing time" delay.

		Certain roles have special behavior. The picture clerk will allow a customer to keep re-
		taking their picture until they "like" it. The passport clerk and cashier will refuse to 
		serve a customer if previous stations are not finished processing their file.

		Stations can take breaks if they don't have customers to serve, the manager tells clerks to 
		go back to their stations if customers begin queueing. The manager also checks on the money
		collected by each station and "reports" the totals. 

		The senator behaves just like a customer, except that when a senator enters the office all
		customers queueing must exit and queue outside until the senator leaves. Likewise, all 
		customers at a station must leave and queue outside once their transaction is finished.

		In addition to the application code, the assignment requires writing a testing menu that 
		allows a user to run the passport office with various numbers of each role. The menu should
		also allow executing pre-defined tests to demonstrate specific functionality.

		All the behavior must be "thread safe" meaning data cannot be corrupted and race conditions
		must be prevented. Details for these requirements have been posted on Blackboard and Piazza.

II. Assumptions:

	Part 1:

	Part 2:

		Customers and senators can be implemented with the same class. Likewise, all clerks 
		(including cashiers, but not the manager) can be implemented with a single class.

		Multiple senators can arrive at the passport office at once. In this case, senators will
		queue outside the office and enter one by one. 

		Station queues are implemented grocery store-style rather than bank-style. Each clerk
		has their own queues for regular customers, bribe customers, and senators.

		Senators have their own line separate from regular customers and bribe customers to prevent
		senators being kicked out of the office when a new senator arrives outside. Senators call
		Broadcast() on all lines to kick customers outside, so a senator itself should never be in
		one of those lines.

III. Design:

	Part 1:

	Part 2:

		When called from main.cc, Problem2() creates default numbers of each role, then shows
		a menu by calling printMenu(). The menu allows changing the numbers of each role, running
		predefined tests, running the overall simulation, or exiting. The overall simulation is 
		run by calling PassportOffice().

		PassportOffice() creates each role and uses Fork() to start each thread. Each role has
		its own code, runCustomer(), runsSenator(), runApplicationClerk(), runPictureClerk(),
		runPassportClerk(), runCashier(), and runManager(). As stated in the assumptions, the 7 
		roles are implemented with 3 classes.

		runCustomer() checks for senators, and queues outside the office if necessary. When it 
		enters, it chooses randomly between filing the application and taking the picture. After
		both have been completed, the customer goes to the passport clerk and then to the cashier.

		runCustomer() accomplishes these actions by executing doApplication(), doPicture(), 
		doPassport(), and doCashier(). At the start of each of these functions, the customer
		calls waitInLine() with arguments specifying the type of clerk the customer wishes to queue
		for. 

		waitInLine() and its associated functions ensure that the customer chooses the shortest
		line, taking into account whether the customer can pay a bribe. We do not assume that the
		bribe line is always the shortest. This code also allows handling senators. When
		runSenator() enters, it sends a Broadcast() to every customer line after setting
		senatorInside = true. The waitInLine() functions respond to either the senator's Broadcast()
		or the clerks' Signal() and respond by either allowing the do...() functions to proceed or
		taking the customer outside. This code can handle the customer being sent outside repeatedly
		and the customer will always return to the apropriate, shortest line, even if the shortest
		line is different from before.

		The customer do...() functions handle interacting with each clerk. They handle special cases
		like rejecting a picture (and waiting in line again) and handling the penalty for arriving
		at a passport clerk or cashier station without already being in posession of the necessary
		documents.

		Likewise, the run...Clerk() functions handle calling customers out of line and interacting
		with them. They will also send the clerks on break as they are allowed to. runManager() 
		starts the manager running in an infinite loop. The manager will send clerks back out off
		break as necessary, and also collects (in a thread-safe way) money totals from each clerk
		and reports them on the console.
